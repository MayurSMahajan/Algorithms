# Algorithms
This repo contains various algorithms that I am implementing myself.
I am practicing various DSA and competitive problems. This repo contains such problems. All the solutions are coded by me, which means that there may be errors in my code. 
If you notice any errors (logical or non-logical), feel free to let me know. Cheers!
